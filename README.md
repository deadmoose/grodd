Dealing with Flash can be a pain. Sometimes you want to tear it limb from limb.
Grodd would like to help with that.

Herein lies my growing collection of hacky little scripts for those times
you need some extra muscle to beat it into submission.

Beware; like most necessity-driven tools, they play pretty fast and loose. I
also wouldn't necessarily recommend relying on their output for production
work (e.g. I would explicitly open an XFL and resave as FLA in Flash itself
rather than trusting packFla)
